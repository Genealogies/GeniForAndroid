# Geni for Android

This app is based on the best open-source genealogy app currently available, [Family Gem](https://www.familygem.app/), which currently has 50K+ downloads on the Google Play store ([link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.familygem)). See the website for its features and screenshots.
