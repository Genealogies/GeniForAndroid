# Family Gem
### Create your own family trees

_Family Gem_ is an app for Android designed to manage family trees.<br>
Project started on beginning of 2018.
It's writen in Java within Android Studio.<br>
The intent is that data structure respects as much as possible the Gedcom standard, in the latest versions 5.5 and 5.5.1.<br>
It's strongly based on the java [Gedcom parser](https://github.com/FamilySearch/Gedcom) by Family Search.<br>
Author is Michele Salvador, an italian self-taught programmer and genealogy enthusiast.

With _Family Gem_ you can:
- Create a family tree from scratch, entering names, dates, places, various events, photos and sources.
- Import an existing family tree through a Gedcom file and modify it as you want.
- Export the family tree you created (via Gedcom again) to import in every other genealogy program.
- Share a tree with your relatives, letting them improve it and receiving back the updates. Then you can choose whether accept them or not.

There are 2 modules:
- **app** is the actual _Family Gem_ app.
- **lab** is the _Family Lab_ app, used only to develop new features.

_Family Gem_ is completely free and open source.

The code (classes, variables, comments...) is all written in italian, because I'm italian and I love to write in my native language. I know it's not so kind, because everyone expects an english code, but I started like this as an hobby project and I will continue like this.

The APK file is stored on [Uptodown](https://family-gem.en.uptodown.com).
