<i>Family Gem</i> is an app for Android designed to manage family trees. It’s completely free and open source.

The intent is that data structure respects as much as possible the Gedcom standard, in the latest versions 5.5 and 5.5.1. It’s strongly based on the Java <a href='https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcom5-java'>parser</a> by Family Search. Author is Michele Salvador, an italian self-taught programmer and genealogy enthusiast.

With <i>Family Gem</i> you can:

* Create a family tree from scratch, entering names, dates, places, various events, photos and sources.
* Import an existing family tree through a Gedcom file and modify it as you want.
* Export the family tree you created (via Gedcom again) to import in every other genealogy program.
* Share a tree with your relatives, letting them improve it and receiving back the updates. Then you can choose whether accept them or not.
